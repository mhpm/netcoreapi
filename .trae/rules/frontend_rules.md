All generated frontend code must strictly follow both UI/UX and engineering best practices:
Universal: WCAG 2.1 AA accessible, mobile-first responsive (tested breakpoints), cross-browser compatible (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge), RTL-ready.
Performant: Optimized assets, lazy loading, minimal CLS, sub-100ms interactions.
Secure: XSS prevention (escape dynamic content), input sanitization, CSP-aware.
Maintainable: Semantic HTML, modern CSS (Grid/Flexbox/variables), modular ES6+ JS, ESLint/Prettier compliant, reusable components.
Sustainable: SEO-friendly structure, clear comments, inclusive patterns (prefers-reduced-motion, color-blind safe).
Non-negotiable: Accessibility, security, and usability always override shortcuts.
